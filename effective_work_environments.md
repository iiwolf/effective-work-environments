## Don't be afraid! The Terminal

* Still don't understand the fuss behind the terminal?
* Coupling terminal and editor
  * Native terminal + vim (Kyle's setup?)
  * Native termainl + emacs (My setup)
* [x] Windows Alternatives
  * Cygwin, MSYS2, GitBash, WSL, CMDER
* [x] Unix single responsibility principle
  * [x] Piping, flags, power of native terminal commands (show example of sed or crazy grep command)
* Putting these commands in a script / alias
* Mouseless development environment
  * You will save time, and it may seem miniscule, but it adds up
  * For me though, the real benefit is it doesn't feel like a chore.
    * Oh now I have to go the mouse, go to the file menu dropdown, search for the right entry,
    hover ove that to get another dropdown, then click on what I want, then get back to typing.
    * If you can reduce the time you even need to think about doing things like this, you'll be happier
    and more efficient. That brilliant idea you had won't get lost in the logistics of implementing it,
    you can do exactly what you want to effictively and effictively.
  * Keeping working towards this even when it feels slow. And soon you'll be confident, not always looking
  things up and wondering if this keystroke is exactly right and if you might accidentally delete your whole file
* Scripts for complete environment setup for whatever computer you are working on (Kyle)
  * .config files
* Window managers, I3
* Terminal tools
  * zsh
  * Tmux, screen, terminator, CMDER
  * [x] fzf
  * [x] autojump
  * [x] bat
  * bench
  * asciinema and svg-term
  * [x] ripgrep
  * [x] fd
  * git workflow
* Terminal Extensions
  * Note keeping : org mode, taskwarrior
  * Slack, email Extensions


## Don't be afraid! Text editor

* [x] Vim, Emacs, and VSCode
* Keybindings, integrating terminal
* Extensions, project/language specific customization
* Pretty colors

## General Environment Stuff

* Alt tabbing
* Workspaces

## VSCode Specific Stuff

* Settings sync
* Integrated terminal
* Tasks

## Motivating Examples

* Ovearching themes: Navigation, Communication, Execution
* Snowballing effect, get more work done faster, being an effective engineer
* Moving a mix of files from one place to another
* Automating a repetitive startup process
* Testing new feature on project with Git branching workflow
  * OSG examples std::array<double,3>* vs std::vector<std::array<double,3>>
* Take every opportunity to streamline your development, testing, communication
* SCP example from Windows to Linux box
* It feels really good when you are able to get out a good product, and have some be
impressed at your work, both in terms of the quality and speed. And on top of that, you had
fun doing it and are ready to jump into the next project.
* Could be the difference between giving up and just trying one more things

Quotes:

"Letâ€™s be clear: I think your development environment is much more important than most developer think. You need to feel at home, comfortably on your couch. You will feel more efficient in a system you built. A system which answers your needs.
Developing will be even more enjoyable."
